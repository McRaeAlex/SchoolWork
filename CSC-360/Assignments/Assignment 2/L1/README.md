# L1 fitting

I create a line from 2 of the points and then go through all the points and get the abs distance from the line to that point. Summing these values. Then taking the 2 points with the minimum sum I print the slope and intercept.

If you remove the define at the top you can change things about the code!

Remove the TWO_THOUSAND_ONE define to make it work on the entire dataset
