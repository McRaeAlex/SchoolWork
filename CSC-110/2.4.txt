Scope:
    
    the part of a program which particular declaration is valid

    Local variable:

        A variable that is only accessable in the structure it is found (method, class, etc)
        
        To understand why you might want to do this think of it as a dorm. each student has their 
        own fridge because if it was just one large fridge everyone grabs from many peoples food
        would go missing.

Pseudocode:

    English-like descriptions of algorithims.
    ex. drawing a box
        //note this is not java
        for (each of 50 lines) {
            draw a line of 30 asterisks
        }

    pseudocode is very easily written down and is used to get ideas down fast that can later be
    turned into code.

Class Constant:

    A non changing value that is given a name and type. these are declared by the term final
    ex. final int number = 10;
