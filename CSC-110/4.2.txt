Cumulative Algorithim:

    An operation in which an overall value is computed incrementally using a
    loop

    Ex. Sum:
        int sum;
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            sum += i; //this is the same as sum = sum + i
        }

Roundoff Errors:

    A numerical error that occurs because floating-point numbers are stored
    as approximations instead of exact values
