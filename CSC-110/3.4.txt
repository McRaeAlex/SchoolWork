Intro to graphics:

    in order to use graphics you must import the awt library
    ex. import java.awt.*;
    awt stands for abstract window toolkit

    To create a new drawing panel you simply call its constructor
    like any other object, it takes two parameters height and width
    ex. DrawingPanel <name> = new DrawingPanel(<width>, <height>);

    Pixel:

        A single small dot on a computer screen

    DrawingPanel Methods:

        getGraphics() --> returns a Graphics obkect that can be used
        to draw onto the panel
        
        setBackground(<color>) --> sets the background color given a
        color as a parameter

    DrawingPanel characteristics:

        The drawing panel works off a coordinate system where 0,0 is
        the top left pixel of the panel

    Graphics Object:

        This is the object that will be used to draw on the panel

        Methods:

            drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2) --> draws a line from the first
            set of coordinates to the second
            
            drawOval(x,y,width,height) --> draws an oval that fits
            the rectangle provided in the parameters
            
            drawRect(x,y,width,height) --> draws a rectangle with the
            given points

            drawString(message,x,y) --> draws the given text with its lower left
            corner being the x-y coordinates

            fillOval(x,y,width,height) --> draws an oval with a color

            fillRect(x,y,width,height) --> draws a rectangle with a color

            setColor(color) --> sets the graphics color

            setFont(font) --> sets the graphics font

        Font:

            A style of characters

        Images:

            DrawingPanel is also able to draw images

            This can be done with the following syntax:
            Image <name> = <panel>.loadImage("<filename>");
            <graphics>.drawImage(<name>, <x>, <y>, <panel>);
