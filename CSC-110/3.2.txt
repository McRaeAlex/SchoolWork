Return Statements:

    Definition:

        The output of a method or function
        It is important to note after a return statement is completed any code after the statement
        in the same function will not be completed.

        Ex.
        public static boolean true() {
            return true;
        }

        Boolean goes instead of void because it defines what type is that we are returning, void
        means your not returning anything

    Format:

        public static <return type> <name>(<parameters>) {
            <statement>
            <statement>
            <statement>
            ...
            <statement>
            return <value>;
        }


The Math Class:

    What is it:

        The math class is a prebuilt java library that contains basiclly all the math you could ever
        want to do in java.

    How to use:

        When you want to use a value or function from the math class you call the class then dot
        then the statement.

        Ex.
        math.sqrt(4);

        OUTPUT: 2

    Common math things:
