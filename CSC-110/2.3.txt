For Loop:

    Suppose you want to do a task multiple times, a for loop with allow you to execute a statement
    multiple times without writing it out each time.

    Structure:

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            <statement>
            <statement>
            ...
            <statement>
        }

        Inside the for loop is considered the body.

    Nested for loops:

        This is for loops within a for loop
        ex.
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
                for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
                    <body>
                }
            }

Control stucture:

    A structure that controls other statements
