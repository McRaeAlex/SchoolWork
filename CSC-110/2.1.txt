Data types:

	A name for a type of data.
	ex. int --> integer
	Java is type-safe which means that users must declare variable types

    Primative types:

        These are data types built into java
        
        int --> integer (1, 2, 3)
        double --> real number (1.3, 3.7)
        char --> single character ('a', '$')
        boolean --> logical values (true, false)

Expressions:
    
    A simple value or set of operations that produces a value
    ex. 42, (2 + 6)

    Evalutation:

        The process of obtaining a value from a given expression

    Operator:

        A symbol used to express a operation
        ex. + --> addition

        Operands:

            Values used in expressions with operators
            ex. (3 + 4)
                3 --> Operand
                4 --> Operand

Literals:

    A squence of digits with or without leading signs (-, +)

    Intager literal:
        type: int
        ex. 3, 482, 456, -12, +45

    Floating point literal:

        type: double
        includes a decimal
        ex. 289.1, 23., 243.12, -456.8, +.9

        Floating point literals can also be expressed with scientific notation
        ex. 2.3e4, -12.7e10

Arithmetic Operators:

    Operators that do math

    + --> addition
    - --> subtraction
    * --> multiplication
    / --> division
    % --> remainder of division (modulus)

    Precedence:

        The binding power of an operator, which determines how to group parts of an expression
        java follows bedmas
        B-rackets
        E-xponents
        D-ivision
        M-ultiplcation
        A-ddtion
        S-ubtraction

Mixing types and casting:

    When doing arithmatic with two differnet types (double, int) java with convert integers into
    doubles.

    ex. 24/2.0 = 12.0 --> double
        24/2 = 12 --> int

    Casting:

        converting one type into another can be done by casting it to its desired type
        ex. (int) 4.75 wil cast the double 4.75 to a integer. it is important to note that casting
        will not round. it will simply drop the decimal
        ex. (int) 4.75 --> 4
