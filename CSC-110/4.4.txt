Preconditions and Postconditions:

    Precondition:

        A condition that must be treu before a method executes in
        order to guarentee the method will work

    Postcondition:

        A condition that the method guarentees will be true after it finishes
        executing, as long as the precondition were true before the method
        was called

    Throwing Execeptions:

        if a condition needs to be met before someting happens we throw an
        exception if its not.

        syntax:

            if (<condition>) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException(<error message>);
            } else {
                <call method>
            }

Return Values revisited:

    Now that if and else are know we can use conditionals to determine what we
    return. Note once a value is returned the method ends

    Syntax:

        public static int <name> (<paramaters>) {
            int x = <statement>;
            int y = <statement>;
            if (<condition>) {
                return x;
            } else {
                return y;
            }

        }
