Variable:

    A memory location with a name and a type that stores a value

    Declaration:

        All variables must be declared, when declaring a variable it is given a name and type.
        Declarations only need to happen once and with throw an error if it happens multiple times.
        ex. int number;
            int --> type
            number --> name

        You can delcare multiple variables of the same type at the same time
        ex. <type> <name>, <name>, ... <name>;

    Assignments:

        After a variable is declared it can be given a value of the same type. This can be done on
        one line.
        ex. int number;
            number = 5
            or
            int number = 5;

        You can assign multiple variables on the same line at the same time
        ex. <type> <name> = <value>, <name> = <value>, ... <name> = <value>;

    Complex assignments/declaration:

        there is more complex ways you can assign and declare variables
        ex. int exp = math.exp(3,2);
        this assigns the value of whatever the method exp returns

String Concatonation:

    Combining multiple strings into one string.
    ex. "Hello " + "world"

    if you have both strings and integers java automaticly converts them
    ex. "Hello " + 3 + "World" --> Hello 3World

Increment/Decrement Operators:

    Instead of saying x = x + 1; we can say x++; or if we want subtraction x--;
