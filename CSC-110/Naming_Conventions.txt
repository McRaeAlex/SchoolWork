Naming conventions:

	java is case sensitive.
	Although you can write a java program on one line readablity helps and requires correct spacing and comments

File names:

	all file names must match the main class and end with ".java". The ".java" means the file has not been compiled yet. Once the file has been compiled a new file will be created with the extension ".class", this is the bytecode.

Classes:

	all names start with capital letters and must match file name, it is common practive to have no special letters.
	Class headers always go on their own line
	ex. Valid: AllMyChildren
		Illegal: allmychildren

Methods:
	
	method headers always go on their own line.
	all methods start with a lower case letter and every word after that is capitalized.
	ex. Valid: allMyChildren
		Illegal: AllMyChildren

Constants:

	all constants must have every letter capitalized and each word must be seperated by a underscore.

Indentifiers:

	A name given to a entity in a program, like a class or method.
	Identifiers must start with a letter, which can be followed by and number of letters or digits.
	ex. valid: first, hiThere, numStudents, Twoby4
		also valid: two_plus_two, _count, $2donntus MAX_COUNT
		ILLEGAL: two+two, hi there, hi-there, 2by4
	Its bettter to make an identifier descriptive rather than short and ambigous
