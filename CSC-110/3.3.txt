Objects:

    Definition:

        A programming entity that contains state (data) and behavior (methods)

    Class:

        A category or type of object in java

    Constructor:

        A method that initalizes an object

    String Objects:

        Sequence of chars

        Functions:

            Length() --> returns the length of the string
            charAt() --> returns the character at a certain index
            subString() --> returns a string from a previous string between 2 index's

        Index:

            Strings are just arrays of characters so each character has a index

            [0,1,2,3]
            [J,a,v,a]

            Index's in java start at 0

    Immutable Objects:

        These are object that their values can never change. This does not mean that they cannot be
        reassigned

    Package:

        A collection of related java classes

        Import declaration:

            import <package>;

            Ex. 
            import java.util.*; //* means import everything
            or
            import java.util.math;

Exceptions:

    Absolutely one of the biggest things you will encounter is runtime exceptions such as null
    pointer exception, these are logic errors. Error handling will be covered later.

Interactive Programs and Scanner Objects:

    Console input:

        Responses typed by the user when an interactive program pauses for input

    Scanner Object:

        This is an object that allows us to read from the command line

        Syntax:

            Scanner <name> = new Scanner(System.in);

        Token:

            A single input from the user these are seperated by whitespace

        Scanner Functions:

            nextInt() --> reads and returns the next int value
            next() --> reads and returns the next token as a string
            nextLine() --> reads the line and returns it as a string
            nextDouble() --> reads and returns the next double

        WhiteSpace:

            Spaces, Tabs, and Newline characters
