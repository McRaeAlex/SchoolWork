Methods:

	A program unit that represents a particualer action or computation. They are callable and can have return statements.

	Main Method:

		Required to create an exacutable java program. How it works is magic.

	Statements:

		Code within a method.
		ex. Public void method (){
			System.out.println("println is a statement");
			}

Semicolons: End statements this is like periods at the end of sentences

Strings:
	
	Strings are surronded by "quotes". Strings may not span more than one line. 
	ex. "Hello
		world" is not valid.
	Strings also must always use double quotes in java.

Escape sequences:

	These are two character sequences that represent one special character.
	\t --> tab character
	\n --> new line character
	\" --> quotation character
	\\ --> baskslash character

	ex. System.out.println("What \"characters\" does this \\ print?");
		OUTPUT: What "Characters" does this \ print

print vs println:
	
	print will print the string however will not start a new line
	ex. System.out.print("Hello ");
		System.out.print("World");
		OUTPUT: Hello World

	println will print the string and start a new line
	ex. System.out.println("Hello");
		Sytem.out.println("World");
		OUTPUT: Hello
				World

Indentifiers:

	A name given to a entity ina program, like a class or method.
	Identifiers must start with a letter, which can be followed by and number of letters or digits.
	ex. valid: first, hiThere, numStudents, Twoby4
		also valid: two_plus_two, _count, $2donntus MAX_COUNT
		ILLEGAL: two+two, hi there, hi-there, 2by4

Comments:

	Text that programmers use to explain their code, this is ignored by the compiler.
	Its a good idea to include a comment at the beggining of a java file to indicate what a class
	does along with information about the author.

	There are two ways you can comment in java:
	/* this is a comment */
	This can be used for commenting multiply lines at once
	ex. /*This
		is
		a
		multi-line
		comment*/

	For single line comments we use:
	// this is a comment
	This type of comment can only be used for one line

	Comments can be used after statements:
	Valid: System.out.println(); //this is a comment after a statement
	But cannot be used before a statement:
	Illegal: //This is a comment before a statement System.out.println();
