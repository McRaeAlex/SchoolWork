Decomposition:

	Breaking down complex problems into smaller more managable ones

	Proceedural:

		Breaking down the problem into steps
		ex. baking a cake

	Object-Oriented:

		Breaking the problem into object that interact with eachother

	Iterative Enhancement:

		Producing a program in stages. Each step being something that can be tested to ensure
		functionality

Static Methods:

	A block of statements given a name. that when called preforms a function.

	Structure:

		public static void <name>(){
			<statement>
			<statement>
			...
		}

	Method calls:

		A command to execute another method, which causes all of the statement inside that ethod to
		be executed. Methods are executed by writing their name with parenthises and a semicolon.
		ex. drawBox();
		A method can always call another method, even itself.

Key words:

	public:

		ideicates that method is available to be used by all parts of your program

	static:

		says that this is non object orientated

	void:

		this says that the function executes statements but does not produce any value

	<name>:

		this is the name of the method

	():

		this is values that could be passed into your method

Flow Control:

	The order in which java statements a executed

Runtime errors:

	a error that compiles fine, but when ran cannot compute.
	ex. 1/0 or creating an inifinte loop
